## Operational Recommendations: Enhanced System

### Daily Monitoring Workflow (Updated):

**Morning Routine (5 minutes):**
1. Check **Thunder Bay** current conditions (primary indicator)
2. Check **Steamboat Springs** yesterday (pattern validation)
3. Check **Chamonix** 5-day history (European signal)
4. Check **Sapporo** 6-day history (Asian jet signal)
5. Check **Niigata** 3-day history (backup Japan signal)

**Pattern Assessment (10 minutes):**
1. Count how many of the above are active (heavy snow >20mm)
2. Calculate weighted ensemble score
3. Determine confidence level:
   - **>70% ensemble active** = HIGH confidence forecast
   - **40-70% active** = MODERATE watch
   - **<40% active** = LOW background signal

**Weekly Review (30 minutes):**
1. Review Siberian patterns (Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Yakutsk)
2. Check Pacific pattern evolution (Mt. Baker, Tahoe)
3. Monitor European Alps trends
4. Update ensemble weights based on recent performance

### Automated Alerting (Recommended):

**HIGH Priority Alert:**
```
IF Thunder Bay >25mm AND
   (Steamboat >20mm yesterday OR
    Chamonix >30mm 5-days-ago OR
    Sapporo >30mm 6-days-ago)
→ Send HIGH CONFIDENCE alert
```

**MODERATE Priority Watch:**
```
IF (Chamonix >25mm 5-days-ago AND Sapporo >25mm 6-days-ago) OR
   (Sapporo >30mm 6-days-ago AND Niigata >30mm 3-days-ago) OR
   Steamboat >30mm yesterday
→ Send MODERATE WATCH notification
```

**BACKGROUND Pattern:**
```
IF Siberia generally active (2+ locations >15mm) over past week
→ Send BACKGROUND INFO (favorable pattern)
```
