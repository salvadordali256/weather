🚀 QUICK START - TRY IT NOW!
================================================================================

1. Run the Weather App (easiest way):
   
   ./venv/bin/python weather_app.py
   
   Enter coordinates when prompted:
   - Eagle River, WI: 45.9169, -89.2443
   - Any location worldwide works!

2. View 85-Year Climate Analysis:
   
   ./venv/bin/python analyze_85year_trends.py
   
   Shows:
   • Location summaries (85 years)
   • Decade-by-decade trends
   • Climate change analysis
   • Record snowstorms
   • Snowiest/least snowy years

3. Quick Data Exploration:
   
   from snowforecast.storage.snowfall_duckdb import SnowfallDuckDB
   engine = SnowfallDuckDB("./northwoods_full_history.db")
   
   # Get data for any year
   df = engine.snowfall_by_year(year=1979)
   print(df)
   
   engine.close()

🎯 WHAT CAN YOU DO?
================================================================================

1. CHECK CURRENT WEATHER (any location worldwide)
   ./venv/bin/python weather_app.py
   
2. GET 7-DAY FORECASTS
   ./venv/bin/python weather_app.py
   (Choose option 2)
   
3. ANALYZE HISTORICAL TRENDS
   ./venv/bin/python analyze_85year_trends.py
   
4. COMPARE DECADES
   Shows 1940s, 1950s, 1960s... through 2020s snowfall trends
   
5. FIND BIGGEST STORMS
   Top 20 snowstorms from 1940-2025 included in analysis
   
6. EXPORT TO CSV/EXCEL
   from snowforecast.storage.snowfall_duckdb import SnowfallDuckDB
   engine = SnowfallDuckDB("./northwoods_full_history.db")
   df = engine.query("SELECT * FROM snowfall.snowfall_daily")
   df.to_csv("my_data.csv")
   engine.close()

================================================================================

from snowforecast.storage.snowfall_duckdb import SnowfallDuckDB

engine = SnowfallDuckDB("./northwoods_full_history.db")

# 1. Find snowiest years
df = engine.query(\"\"\"
    SELECT
        YEAR(CAST(date AS DATE)) as year,
        ROUND(SUM(snowfall_mm) / 10.0, 1) as total_cm
    FROM snowfall.snowfall_daily
    GROUP BY year
    ORDER BY total_cm DESC
    LIMIT 10
\"\"\")

# 2. Compare specific winters
df = engine.query(\"\"\"
    SELECT date, station_id,
           ROUND(snowfall_mm / 10.0, 1) as snow_cm
    FROM snowfall.snowfall_daily
    WHERE date BETWEEN '1978-11-01' AND '1979-04-30'
        AND snowfall_mm > 50
    ORDER BY snowfall_mm DESC
\"\"\")

# 3. Monthly averages by decade
df = engine.query(\"\"\"
    SELECT
        (YEAR(CAST(date AS DATE)) / 10) * 10 as decade,
        MONTH(CAST(date AS DATE)) as month,
        ROUND(AVG(snowfall_mm) / 10.0, 1) as avg_cm
    FROM snowfall.snowfall_daily
    WHERE snowfall_mm > 0
    GROUP BY decade, month
